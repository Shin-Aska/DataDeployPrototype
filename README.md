# About Opensource Prototype
The Opensource Prototype project aims to have a working version that can compete with ESRI's ArcGIS using Opensource technology such as PHP, OpenLayers and GeoServer. Although there are plans to support other technologies in parallel as well.

# Getting Started
1) Project Files: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hH4ffAgpU3q77DlJJ0WVKavwxKDXdaVZ?usp=sharing
2) Install the following:
    * LAMP (For Linux) or WAMP (for Windows)
    * MySQL Geoserver Plugin (Comes bundled on the PostGreSQL)s
    * Geoserver 2.12.1
3) Read the documentation found in the documentations folder (you automatically obtain a copy once you clone the repository) which comes available in multiple formats (Even in HTML!)

For more questions or you want to discuss and implement new things. Chat with the rest of the OpenSource Team at [Slack](http://datadeployteam.slack.com/)
